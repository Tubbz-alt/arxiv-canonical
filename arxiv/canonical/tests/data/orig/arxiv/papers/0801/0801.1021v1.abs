  We present arguments for the existence of five-dimensional rotating black
holes with equal magnitude angular momenta in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with
negative cosmological constant. These solutions posses a regular horizon of
spherical topology and approach asymptotically an Anti-de Sitter spacetime
background. We discuss the general properties of these solutions and, using an
adapted counterterm prescription, we compute their entropy and conserved
charges.
