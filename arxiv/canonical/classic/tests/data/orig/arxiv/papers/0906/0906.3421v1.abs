  We review the solution of the $A_r$ Q-systems in terms of the partition
function of paths on a weighted graph, and show that it is possible to modify
the graphs and transfer matrices so as to provide an explicit connection to the
theory of planar networks introduced in the context of totally positive
matrices by Fomin and Zelevinsky.
