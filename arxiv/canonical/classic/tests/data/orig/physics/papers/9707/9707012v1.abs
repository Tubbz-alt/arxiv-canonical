Title: Supersymmetric partner chirping of Newtonian free damping
Authors: H. Rosu, J.L. Romero
Comments: 3pp

  We connect the classical free damping cases by means of Rosner's construction
in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Starting with the critical damping, one
can obtain in the underdamping case a chirping of instantaneous physical
frequency \omega ^{2}(t) \propto \omega _{u}^{2}sech^2(\omega _{u}t), whereas
in the overdamped case the "chirping" is of the (unphysical) type \omega
^{2}(t)\propto\omega _{o}^{2}sec^{2}(\omega _{o}t), where \omega _{u} and
\omega _{o} are the underdamped and overdamped frequency parameters,
respectively
