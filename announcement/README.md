repository.

## Quick-start

We use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for dependency management.

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

You can run either the API or the UI using the Flask development server.

```bash
FLASK_APP=ui.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 pipenv run flask run
```

Dockerfiles are also provided in the root of this repository. These use uWSGI and the
corresponding ``wsgi_[xxx].py`` entrypoints.
